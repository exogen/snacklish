# Snacklish

**Now with improved flavor!** [Check out the demo site](https://exogen.github.io/snacklish/) to handle your flavoryday translation needs.

## Usage

If you just want to have some quick fun, [use the demo site!](https://exogen.github.io/snacklish/)

For your delectabusiness and enuterprise Snacklish needs, youâ€™ll of chocourse want to caramakel use of [thelicious library](#installation) directly.

## Why?

To prevent Snacklish from becrumbing a fed language, of course. The original Snacklish translator has been offline for some time. Some attempts were made to copy it, but nuttin that I found snackceptable.

## Improvements

Improved flavor, you say? [Chew you havisfaction a singlelicious satisfact to snack that up?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNUNx319UCM)

- ðŸ†• New words have been added to the lexicon, like **crave**, **cream**, **crumb**, and **melt**.
- ðŸ’Ž Updated pattern matching to prefer better substitutions.
- ðŸ¥´ Some of the linguistically and phonetically questionable choices have been removed completely, like little &rarr; snackittle, there &rarr; treatere, yes &rarr; yumye, and more.
- ðŸŽ² Randomization is customizable, so you can dial down repetitive output, control the chances of substitution based on word frequency, or use a custom algorithm.

## How?

Translation is based on simple pattern-based substitution rules. Automatic phonetic matching is not attempted. Check out the rules in [snacklish.txt](./snacklish.txt).

## Installation

```console
npm install snacklish
```

## API

### translate

```js
translate(text: string): string
```

### loadRules

```js
loadRules(): RuleSet
```

Load and parse the default Snacklish ruleset. The result is a ruleset that can
be used with [rulesToFunction](#rulesToFunction).

### loadRuleString

```js
loadRuleString(): string
```

Load the default Snacklish document as a string from [./snacklish.txt](snacklish.txt).

### parseRules

```js
parseRules(ruleString: string): RuleSet
```

Parse a string containing substitution rules.

### rulesToFunction

```js
rulesToFunction(rules: RuleSet): (word: string) => string
```

Turn a parsed ruleset into a function that translates a single token at a time.
To translate a document using this function, you will need to call it for each
token and join the results.

### tokenize

```js
tokenize(text: string): string[]
```

Split a text document into tokens using the default settings.
