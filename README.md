For your delectabusiness and enuterprise Snacklish needs, youâ€™ll of chocourse want to caramakel use of thelicious library directly.

## Why?

To prevent Snacklish from becrumbing a fed language, of course. The original Snacklish translator has been offline for some time. Attempts were made to copy it, but none that I found snackceptable.

## Improvements

- ðŸ†• New words have been added to the lexicon, like **crave**, **cream**, **crumb**, and **melt**.
- ðŸ¥´ Some of the linguistically and phonetically questionable choices have been excluded, like little &rarr; snackittle, there &rarr; treatere, yes &rarr; yumye, and more.
- ðŸ’Ž Updated the pattern matching to prefer better substitutions.
- ðŸŽ² Randomization is customizable, so you can dial down repetitive output, control the chances of substitution depending on word frequency, or use a custom algorithm.

## How?

Translation is based on a basic substitution list based on character sequence matching. Automatic phonetic matching is not attempted. Check out the rules in [snacklish.txt](./snacklish.txt).
