# Snacklish

**Now with improved flavor!** [Check out the demo site](https://exogen.github.io/snacklish/)
to handle your flavoryday translation needs.

## Introduction

Snacklish is a ridiculous language invented by Snickers and based on snack-related
wordplay. This library (and demo site) exist to automatically translate English
to Snacklish.

If you just want to have some quick fun, [use the demo site!](https://exogen.github.io/snacklish/)

For your delectabusiness and enuterprise Snacklish needs, youâ€™ll of chocourse want
to caramakel use of [thelicious library](#installation) directly.

## Why?

To prevent Snacklish from becrumbing a fed language, of course. The original Snacklish
translator has been offline for far chew long. Some attempts were made to chompy
it, but nuttin that I found snackceptable.

## Improvements

Improved flavor, you say? [Chew you havisfaction a singlelicious satisfact to snack that up?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNUNx319UCM)

- ðŸ†• New words have been added to the lexicon, like **crave**, **cream**, **crumb**,
  and **melt**.
- ðŸ’Ž Updated pattern matching to prefer better substitutions.
- ðŸ¥´ Some of the linguistically and phonetically questionable choices have been
  removed completely, like little &rarr; snackittle, there &rarr; treatere, yes
  &rarr; yumye, and more.
- ðŸŽ² Randomization is customizable, so you can dial down repetitive output, control
  the chances of substitution based on word frequency, or use a custom algorithm.

## How?

Translation is based on simple pattern-based substitution rules. Automatic phonetic
matching is not attempted. Check out the rules in [snacklish.txt](./snacklish.txt).

## Installation

```console
npm install snacklish
```

## Usage

```ts
import { translate } from "snacklish";

translate("hello, world!");
// -> "caramello, chocoworld!"
```

## API

### translate

Translate an entire text document to Snacklish.

```ts
translate(text: string): string
```

### loadRules

Load and parse the default Snacklish ruleset. The result is a ruleset that can
be used with [rulesToFunction](#rulesToFunction).

```ts
loadRules(): RuleSet
```

### loadRuleString

Load the default Snacklish document as a string from [snacklish.txt](./snacklish.txt).

```ts
loadRuleString(): string
```

### parseRules

Parse a string containing substitution rules.

```ts
parseRules(ruleString: string): RuleSet
```

### rulesToFunction

Turn a parsed ruleset into a function that translates a single token at a time.
To translate a document using this function, you will need to call it for each
token and join the results.

```ts
rulesToFunction(
  rules: RuleSet,
  options: { getProbability: (token: string) => number }
): (token: string) => string
```

### tokenize

Split a text document into tokens using the default tokenizer.

```ts
tokenize(text: string): string[]
```
